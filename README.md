Graph Extractor usage example for the library and examples created by Gabriele Sgroi, PhD in the article "How To Build a Multi-Source Knowledge Graph Extractor from Scratch".

IMPORTANT:  Errors in the file relations.py from Gabriele Sgroi library were corrrected.  After installing the library as he described, update the file relations.py in the "kg_builder" folder with the file I have provided.
